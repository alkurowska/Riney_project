Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous bone marrow malignancy characterized by distinct patterns of plasma cellsâ€™ clonal evolution. MM is preceded by asymptomatic stages: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). Using state-of-the-art sequencing technologies, we aim to decipher regulatory mechanisms underlying disease progression in both patient samples and mouse models. By identifying relevant transcription factors and constructing gene regulatory networks, we aim to understand the transition from precursor states to symptomatic multiple myeloma.
